# automkv

This [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) script automatically invokes the [MakeMKV](https://www.makemkv.com) command-line app when a Blu-ray disc is inserted to your computer. When MakeMKV is finished with the disc, it is ejected. This makes it very convenient for use with multiple-disc sets.

The script currently only supports macOS. It can be started from the Terminal app, and left running in the background.

You can set the `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` path to something appropriate for your system.
